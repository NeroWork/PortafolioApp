            <h2>A bit about my life</h2>
            <p>I am Argentine, I was born in 2002, and I love programming. From a very young age, I have always been interested in technology and computer issues, and since then, I have been involved in these areas. I graduated from high school as an electromechanical technician and at this moment I am in my third year of computer science. I love playing videogames, reading books, talking about the crazy things that happen in the world, and above all, thinking about the future and learning new things to reach it as I imagine it.</p>

            <h2>Things I did</h2>
            <p>I have extensive experience in C++, the language I learned in college. In fact, in addition to the large number of problems solved, I also created my own video game on it.
            I also have a formal education in web development with HTML, CSS, JS, and React on the front-end; and with MongoDB, Node, Passport, Express, and other tools in back-end. I did several courses with CoderHouse, you can see them at LinkedIn along with some projects ;)</p>
